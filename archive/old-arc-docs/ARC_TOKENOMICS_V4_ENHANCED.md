## 🔥 NEW: Built-in Burn Mechanism

### How Burns Work:

**1. Transaction Fee Burns (Automatic)**
```
Every token swap in Arc wallet: 0.5% fee
├─ 0.25% → Liquidity pool
├─ 0.15% → Stakers
└─ 0.10% → BURNED 🔥

Example:
User swaps 1000 ARC → 1 ARC burned
1M daily volume → 1000 ARC/day burned
365M annual volume → 365k ARC/year burned
```

**2. Revenue Buyback Burns (Quarterly)**
```
Arc wallet generates revenue from:
├─ Premium subscriptions
├─ Virtual card fees
├─ Swap fees
└─ Partnership commissions

50% of profits → Buy ARC on market → BURN 🔥

Example:
$1M annual revenue → $500k buyback → ~25M ARC burned @ $0.02
```

**3. Unclaimed Reward Burns (Annual)**
```
Staking/cashback rewards not claimed after 2 years:
└─ BURNED 🔥

Estimated: 2-3M ARC/year
```

### Burn Impact:

**Year 1:**
- Transaction burns: ~500k ARC
- Revenue buyback: ~10M ARC
- Unclaimed: ~2M ARC
- **Total: ~12M burned (1.2%)**

**Year 5:**
- Transaction burns: ~5M ARC
- Revenue buyback: ~50M ARC
- Unclaimed: ~5M ARC
- **Total: ~60M burned (6%)**

**Year 10:**
- **Total burned: ~200-300M ARC (20-30%)**
- **Supply: 1B → 700-800M**

**Deflationary = Price goes UP! 📈**

Fee tier: 0.3%
```

**PancakeSwap (Binance Smart Chain):**
```
30M ARC + $200k BNB

## ❌ NO Anti-Dump Mechanisms

**Why we're NOT including anti-dump:**

### Bitcoin doesn't have it:
```
BTC: ✅ Send any amount, any time
ETH: ✅ Send any amount, any time
SOL: ✅ Send any amount, any time
ARC: ✅ Send any amount, any time
```

### Anti-dump is for:
- ❌ Memecoins (SHIB, DOGE)
- ❌ Scamcoins
- ❌ Projects with no confidence
- ❌ Pump & dump schemes

### Arc doesn't need it because:
- ✅ We have proper vesting (70% locked)
- ✅ We're transparent (public wallets)
- ✅ We have real utility (not a memecoin)
- ✅ We trust our holders (no babysitting)

**Free market = best market** 🌈
